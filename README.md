### Directory
- `archive`: history
- `data`: origin train data
- `config`: setting files for model parameters
- `doc`: documents, images, reports
- `pipeline`: ANN models, PATCHTST models
- `results`: Random Forest models
- `requirements.txt`: required libraries and packages

### How to Run
1) `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages
2) Set the mode in the pipeline model's config
3) you can choose one between two options : split = train, test, predict_mode = one_step, dynamic
4) also choose select_channel_idx = <br> # 0, # elec_amount (This must be used) <br>
                                      # 1, # temp<br>
                                      # 2, # wind_speed<br>
                                      # 3, # humidity<br>
                                      # 4, # rainfall<br>
                                      # 5, # sunshine<br>
                                      # 6, # rolling_mean<br>
                                      # 7, # diff<br>
5) then, try this!
